Xiaomi Dolby
==============

Getting Started
---------------
For dolby media codecs to work add this line in your media codecs config (should be in vendor partition) :-

```bash
<Include href="media_codecs_dolby_audio.xml" />
```

To build, add the dolby effects in your device's audio effects config then inherit the dolby config by adding this in your device's makefile :-

```bash
$(call inherit-product, hardware/dolby/dolby.mk)
```

Now, moving hidl definitions in manifest to device trees is completely absurd so stop overriding manifest in your device trees an example for such would be :-

Changing these in BoardConfig makefile of your device tree:-

```bash
DEVICE_FRAMEWORK_COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX_FILE :=
```
And

```bash
DEVICE_MANIFEST_FILE :=
```

To:-

```bash
DEVICE_FRAMEWORK_COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX_FILE +=
```
And

```bash
DEVICE_MANIFEST_FILE +=
```

The only change done above is changing := symbol to += so that manifest can't be overriden from device tree in BoardConfig makefile.

At the end an example commit to properly implement it in your device tree could be :-
